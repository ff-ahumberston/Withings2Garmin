## Automated sync

Now you can utilize crontab as scheduler of script runs. It will allow to synchronize your measurements and you can forget about the script. In below exaple Raspberry Pi was used as server.

Execute ```crontab -e```

```
 */5 * * * * /home/pi/Withings2Garmin/run.sh >> /home/pi/cron.log 2>&1
```

This approach allows simple loging to ```/home/pi/cron.log``` directory.
